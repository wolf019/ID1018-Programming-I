Focus in the assignments (uppgifter)

Obligatoric Assignments:

OA1
1. Basic programming: manage loops, conditions and arrays, and standard input and output.
2. Data structures: understand one- and twodimensional arrays.
3. Algorithms: understand the summing algorithm and the update algorithm (in order to determine the least and greatest value in an array).

OA2
1. Basic programming: methods, distribute code between methods and classes; using the standard library.
2. Algorithms: computation algorithms.

OA3
1. Basic programming: using loops, arrays, and methods; distributing code between methods and classes.
2. Algorithms: specify a problem and its instances; finding an algorithm, and describing it with words and symbols (pseudocode); implementing an algorithm; the update strategy; the efficiency of an algorithm.
3. Data structures: understand one- and twodimensional arrays.

OA4
1. Basic programming: a program consisting of several methods; using the standard library.
1
2. Object-oriented programming: create and use objects.
3. Algorithms: computation algorithms; visualise, describe and implement algorithms.
4. Data structures: understand character strings.

OA5
1. Object-oriented programming: a model of a concept; the storage structure of an object; visualise an object; using an object; objects that exist on top of another object.
2. Data structures: an object having an array of objects.
3. Algorithms: algorithms related to a sequence of elements; iterating through a sequence; memory efficiency and time efficiency.
4. Exceptions: handling an exceptional situation in a method.
