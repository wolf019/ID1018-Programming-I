## Focus in the assignments (uppgifter)

### Obligatoric Assignments:

### OA1
* Basic programming: manage loops, conditions and arrays, and standard input and output.
* Data structures: understand one- and twodimensional arrays.
* Algorithms: understand the summing algorithm and the update algorithm (in order to determine the least and greatest value in an array).

### OA2
* Basic programming: methods, distribute code between methods and classes; using the standard library.
* Algorithms: computation algorithms.

### OA3
* Basic programming: using loops, arrays, and methods; distributing code between methods and classes.
* Algorithms: specify a problem and its instances; finding an algorithm, and describing it with words and symbols (pseudocode); implementing an algorithm; the update strategy; the efficiency of an algorithm.
* Data structures: understand one- and twodimensional arrays.

### OA4
* Basic programming: a program consisting of several methods; using the standard library.
* Object-oriented programming: create and use objects.
* Algorithms: computation algorithms; visualise, describe and implement algorithms.
* Data structures: understand character strings.
 
### OA5
* Object-oriented programming: a model of a concept; the storage structure of an object; visualise an object; using an object; objects that exist on top of another object.
* Data structures: an object having an array of objects.
* Algorithms: algorithms related to a sequence of elements; iterating through a sequence; memory efficiency and time efficiency.
* Exceptions: handling an exceptional situation in a method.

### Extra Assignments:

### EA1
* Basic programming: logic and arrayss; testing a method.
* Algorithms: finding errors in an algorithm; the separations strategy. 3. Data structures: using arrays.

### EA2
* Algorithms: exchange sort and selection sort.

### EA3
